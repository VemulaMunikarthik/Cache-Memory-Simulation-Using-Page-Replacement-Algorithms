# Cache-Memory-Simulation-Using-Page-Replacement-Algorithms
\Developed a cache management system, tailoring cache size, associativity, and block size. Implemented LRU, FIFO, and other replacement policies for efficient content management. Vital for enhancing multiprocessor system performance.
To run the module
install all the modules that are imported in the app.py
change the source and destination address to Your Address in line 62 in app.py
run app.py and Copy paste Port address in search engine
now intially Your Cache memory is empty , so upto first 3 videos no need selection any algorithm as there is empty slots incache memory
from 4 th video that u have searched it is needed to  select the algorithm that ypu want to replace the video
If u select FIFO then, the video which came first will deleted and new video that you have search will be appended in chache memory ,it will take some time to load from main memory ,main memory in the sense Youtube
If u select LRU then, the video that has been least recently used will be deleted and new video that you have search will be appended in chache memory ,it will take some time to load from main memory ,main memory in the sense Youtube
if the video that you have searches in the cache memory then,it will take 0 seconds to load which will be displayed on the screen
